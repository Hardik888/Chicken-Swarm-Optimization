# Chicken-Swarm-Optimization
A new bio-inspired algorithm, Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO), is proposed for optimization applications. Mimicking the hierarchal order in the chicken swarm and the behaviors of the chicken swarm, including roosters, hens and chicks, CSO can efficiently extract the chickensâ€™ swarm intelligence to optimize problems.
